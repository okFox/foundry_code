// Dialogue pop up box asking for DC of lock and required number of Successes
// Continuously rolls the selected characters thievery roll against the DC and counts the number of rolls made until one of two conditions are met. 
// Either A) The number of Successes has been met (at which point output the total number of attempts made times 6 / or if it's easier just total number of attempts made)
// Or B) a critical failure occurs (so DC-10) at which point again output total number of attempts made either times 6 or not



// get DC

// get number of successes needed

//set crit fail value (DC - 10)

//track attempts and keep rolling until:

    // === num of successes rolled
        //  return attempts * 6
    
// OR

    //crit fail rolled
        // return attempts * 6
