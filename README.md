This is a macro for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

It is intended to allow the GM to enter a DC and a number of successes needed to pick a lock.

The macro will take the thievery skill of the selected token and keep rolling until either the number of successes is met or a critical fail occurs. 

It will then output to chat the result, how many attempt (rounds) it took and the number of seconds in duration.
